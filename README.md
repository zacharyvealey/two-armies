# two-armies
A program to try and find the best allocation of soldiers to castles.

The following brainteaser was proposed by The Riddler - FiveThirtyEight at https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-battle-for-riddler-nation-round-2/. The included Python program tries to smartly find the best allocation of soldiers to castles by randomly generating an army and then having it face off against a user-defined number of other armies (>1000) and tracks how well it performs. A new army is then chosen by picking which distribution gained the most points against the previous army and then submits that army against the gauntlet. The top five armies are tracked along with their winning percentages.

"In a distant, war-torn land, there are 10 castles. There are two warlords: you and your archenemy, with whom you’re competing to collect the most victory points. Each castle has its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror. Specifically, the castles are worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9, and 10 victory points. You and your enemy each have 100 soldiers to distribute, any way you like, to fight at any of the 10 castles. Whoever sends more soldiers to a given castle conquers that castle and wins its victory points. If you each send the same number of troops, you split the points. You don’t know what distribution of forces your enemy has chosen until the battles begin. Whoever wins the most points wins the war. Submit a plan distributing your 100 soldiers among the 10 castles."
